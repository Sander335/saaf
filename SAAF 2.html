					Introduction & History
				</u>
			</p>
		</center>
		<p style="text-align: left; padding: 10px;">
			The San Andreas Armed Forces are the military forces of the States of San Andreas. They consist of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard.
			<br>
			<br>
			San Andreas has a strong tradition of civilian control of the military. While the President is the overall head of the military, the San Andreas Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, is the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. The DoD is headed by the Secretary of Defense, who is a civilian and a member of the Cabinet, who also serves as the President's second-in-command of the military. To coordinate military action with diplomacy, the President has an advisory National Security Council headed by a National Security Advisor. Both the President and Secretary of Defense are advised by a six-member Joint Chiefs of Staff, which includes the head of each of Department of Defense service branches, led by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Commandant of the Coast Guard is not a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
			<br>
			<br>
			All of the branches work together jointly during operations, under the Unified Combatant Commands, under the authority of the Secretary of Defense with the exception the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard falls under the administration of the Department of Homeland Security and receives its operational orders from the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Coast Guard may be transferred to the Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during a time of war. All five armed services are among the seven uniformed services of the United States; the others are the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps.
			<br>
			<br>
			From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of San Andreas. A sense of national unity and identity was forged out of the victorious Barbary Wars, as well as the War of 1812. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force and not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established.
			<br>
			<br>
			The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the onset of the Cold War, created the modern S.A. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.
			<br>
			<br>
			The S.A. military is one of the largest militaries in terms of number of personnel. It draws its manpower from a large pool of volunteers; although conscription has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1972. As of 1999, San Andreas spends about $692 billion annually to fund its military forces, constituting approximately 43 percent of world military expenditures (As of 1998). The S.A. Armed Forces as a whole possess large quantities of advanced and powerful equipment, which gives them significant capabilities in both defense and power projection.

						<strong>
							The Patriot High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicle
						</strong>
						<br>
						The Patriot has medium top speed, due to its heavy weight. It is very durable, and has outstanding off-road capabilities, mainly because of high ground clearance, unusual width, and suspension. It can climb very steep gradients due to its standard low-range gearbox, and does not roll, due to the low center of gravity. Because of the low-end torque and acceleration, its engine seems large, especially in first and second gear, and is quite quick for such a large, heavy truck, it is widely assumed that the Patriot has a high-displacement V8. Although it is powerful, caution should be used when driving over vehicles as the Patriot has a tendency to roll over and catch fire. It should also be noted that the Patriot has bulletproof windshields, like the Securicar.
						<br>
						<br>
						The performance of this car is very good. It's the best car for going to the countryside of the game, same as the Huntley. It has a lot of resistance, making it a nice choice to drive long journeys. Summarizing, the performance of this car is almost the same of the Huntley.

						<strong>
							The Barracks OL 6x6 Utility Truck
						</strong>
						<br>
						The Barracks OL 5-ton 6x6 truck is a vehicle of the San Andreas military logistical transportation trucks which was designed in the late 1980s and has been in service ever since. About 32,000 Barracks OL series trucks are in service. The Barracks OL series is an improved version of the older Barracks series of trucks.
						<br>
						<br>
						Although it is one of the heaviest vehicles, it is faster than the much lighter Flatbed; due to its length and its two rear axles, however, it suffers from understeer at higher speeds. Its ramming power is impressive; it can easily penetrate a SWAT roadblock. The Barracks OL has all-wheel drive, but, because of its size and weight, it can easily get stuck in off-road terrain. Despite its size, the Barracks will explode if it collides with a Rhino tank, just as other vehicles do. The Barracks OL has an average top speed but the acceleration leaves much to be desired.

						<strong>
							The Rhino Tank
						</strong>
						<br>
						The Rhino is a third-generation main battle tank produced in San Andreas. It is named after General Creighton Abrams, former Army Chief of Staff and Commander of SA military forces in Vietnam from 1968 to 1972. The Rhino is a well armed, heavily armored, and highly mobile tank designed for modern armored ground warfare. Notable features of the tank include the use of a powerful gas turbine engine (fueled with JP8 jet fuel), the adoption of sophisticated composite armor, and separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment for crew safety. With a weight of close to 68 short tons (almost 62 metric tons), it is one of the heaviest main battle tanks currently in service.
						<br>
						<br>
						This tank has 2 steering modes: normal allows it to make turns a little better than trucks, and extra, activated with the handbrake, allows to make extra tight turns. It has little better off-road abilities, but it is still far from perfect. It has better acceleration and grip, but it still cannot go through high obstacles. It handles better on road. The turret now points to where the player's camera is pointed, making it difficult to aim in some circumstances. It has no lights or sirens.
						<br>
						<br>
						The Rhino entered SA service in 1980, replacing the 105 mm gun, full tracked old Rhino. The Rhino remains the principal main battle tank of the San Andreas Army. It is anticipated to continue in SA service until the 2010s.

						<strong>
						The Hydra
						</strong>
						<br>
						The Hydra is the most sophisticated aircraft, boasting a variety of equipment. One of its more prominent abilities is its VTOL (Vertical Take Off and Landing) capabilities, which allow it to hover, descend or ascend vertically like a helicopter, and travel horizontally like an airplane; these abilities are achieved by directing thrust from four jet outlets downwards or backward using specific directional controls Due to its excellent engine and maneuverability, the Hydra is the fastest and fail-deadly aircraft (and one of the fastest vehicles) , with a fixed top speed of 500 mph, and while hovering; 200 mph and one of the easiest to fly when the pilot learns the basics of fixed-wing flight.
						<br>
						<br>
						The Hydra comes with various armaments, including lock-on or manual-aimed missiles, and flares as countermeasures for oncoming missiles fired by enemies, which redirects lock-on missiles shot from enemy Hydra.
						<br>
						<br>
						The Hydra is the most preferred aircraft for its speed, agility, and weapons which make it an excellent choice for nearly any purpose requiring an airplane. Its chief disadvantage comes not from the vehicle itself, but the game engine - high-speed flight can allow the plane to hit objects, such as trees, before they've become visible due to model/texture loading being slower than the plane itself (this process is also nick-named 'pop-in'). Another drawback is that there is no passenger or co-pilot seat, restricting it to only carry one person, making it unsuitable for several-man transport.

						<strong>
							The Hunter
						</strong>
						<br>
						The Hunter is one of (if not) the fastest helicopters. It has high handling, but has wide turning radius. Unlike many other helicopters, the Hunter cannot automatically stabilize at 45 degrees when keeping the control thumbstick forward, as doing so will result the Hunter getting upside down, loosing control and eventually crashing.
						<br>
						<br>
						The Hunter is easy to control and is a good choice to fly between structures in cities. However, the Hunter can easily get upside down when moving the helicopter at high speed. It is highly resistant to damage, but is by no means indestructible.
						<br>
						<br>
						The Hunter has two sets of weapons, which consist of a Hughes M230 30mm chain gun mounted on the chin and dual Hydra 70 rocket pods. This weaponry makes the Hunter a deadly vehicle. The chain gun is autonomous and automatically lock/fire at targets in its radius (~ 45 degrees). The rocket pods will fire two rockets at once. These are unguided, but the high rate of fire of the rockets and the good handling of the helicopter make the rockets easy to use and devastating. Like the Rhino, the Sea Sparrow and the Hydra, all weapons have unlimited ammunition.

						<strong>
							The Cargobob Utility Helicopter
						</strong>
						<br>
						The Cargobob is the largest and heaviest helicopter in the game. Its fuselage is most reminiscent of a CH-47 Chinook (bulging fuel tanks, engine, cockpit/nose design, rear loading ramp); however, it has been given a different configuration resembling the smaller Sikorsky S-92. It also features a Fenestron-style tail rotor.
						<br>
						<br>
						Although the Cargobob features an open rear loading compartment, it cannot carry other vehicles, as the ramp from the back cannot be operated. It is very slow due to its weight. As the Cargobob is very heavy, it is difficult to adjust altitude, turn, or conduct other evasive maneuvers; it also lacks any form of defense. It is, however, very strong - it can take over 12 missiles before catching on fire. Having only two doors, the Cargobob is only capable of seating two. The Cargobob is then a poor choice as an helicopter.

				The M4 Carbine Rifle
			</strong>
			<br>
			The M4 Carbine Rifle has a good rate of fire for an usual assault rifle, but it also has considerably less power. Even though, it is still highly effective, featuring a 50-round STANAG magazine and a smaller crosshair than that of the AK-47, making it useful for more precise and accurate shots.M4 is the modified version of the M-16, the shortened stock and barrel makes it more compact while still retaining the accuracy and power of its cousin. The weapon will allow the player the pinpoint accuracy to target an opponents specific body parts or vehicle tires. Kneeling greatly increases the accuracy of the M4,but kneeling might bring your death faster than you think so be careful when you use it in that way. Even while kneeling, it is possible to roll side to side.

			<strong>
				The Desert Eagle Combat Pistol
			</strong>
			<br>
			This handgun delivers an unparalleled degree of accuracy and power with a distinctive feel that soldiers will pick up on immediately. Originally intended to be target/sport pistol, soldiers will use this weapon for the immense stopping power the handgun’s .50 caliber rounds deliver to a target—stopping assailants in their tracks, usually with one well placed shot. Because of its significant recoil, it’s almost impossible to hold onto at first. Look for higher levels of skill with the weapon to reduce this effect and yield quicker reloads and accuracy. The benefit of this approach is it allows sniper results with the free movement offered by a handgun

			<strong>
				The High-Explosive Grenades
			</strong>
			<br>
			Long carried by infantry soldiers to aid in removal of pesky hardened positions and enemies hiding behind things, grenades are quite simple in theory. Step 1: pull pin, step 2: throw, and step 3: try not to be nearby when they explode. When used properly, grenades do a bang-up job of taking out cars (and anybody who might use them for cover) and clearing out closed in areas filled with opponents. When used improperly on the other hand, you can just as easily blow yourself up and/or any cars nearby you may be using for cover. If you're not careful, you might also end up causing a chain reaction in congested areas which ends with exploded cars all about and lots of police attention. But then, that may very well be the desired effect in some cases...
